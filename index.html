            <p>World War I (1914-1918) and World War II (1939-1945) were two of the most devastating conflicts in human history, causing unprecedented destruction and loss of life. World War I, sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, involved the Allied Powers (France, Britain, Russia, and later the U.S.) against the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire). The war introduced deadly technologies like 
              trench warfare, machine guns, and poison gas, leading to millions of deaths and widespread ruin across Europe. Economically, it left nations in chaos, with food shortages and inflation fueling political instability. Just two decades later, World War II erupted, initiated by Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland.
               It grew into a global conflict between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) and the Allies
                (U.S., Britain, the Soviet Union, and China). The war caused even greater destruction, including the Holocaust,
                 the bombings of cities like London, Dresden, and Hiroshima, and the use of nuclear weapons. By the end, over 60
                  million people were dead, much of Europe and Asia lay in ruins, and the global political landscape was irrevocably altered.</p>

        <h2>Impact of War</h2>
        <p>Wars have a lasting impact on economics, society, technology, and politics. Discover how wars have reshaped the world.</p>
        <div class="impact-grid">
            <div class="impact-item">
                <h3>Economic Impacts</h3>
                <p>The world wars had both negative and positive economic impacts. On the negative side, both wars
                   caused widespread destruction of infrastructure, industries, and agriculture, particularly in Europe
                    and parts of Asia. Countries faced massive debts, inflation, and economic instability, leading to shortages
                     of basic goods and widespread poverty. Many economies were left in ruins, requiring years of rebuilding. However,
                      the wars also stimulated economic growth in some regions, particularly the United States, which saw a booming industrial
                       sector due to increased demand for military supplies. After World War II, many countries benefited from reconstruction efforts
                        like the Marshall Plan, which revitalized war-torn European economies. Technological advancements made during the wars, such as
                         in manufacturing and logistics, 
                  also had long-term positive effects, driving innovation and modernization in various industries.</p>

            <div class="impact-item">
                <h3>Social & Cultural Impact</h3>
                <p>The world wars had profound social and cultural impacts, both negative and positive. Negatively, they caused 
                  immense human suffering, with millions of deaths, displacements, and widespread trauma, particularly among soldiers 
                  and civilians in war-torn regions. The wars also deepened societal divisions, such as class and racial tensions, and 
                  led to the rise of totalitarian regimes. However, the wars also had positive social and cultural consequences. They 
                  accelerated social changes, such as the rise of women's rights, as women took on roles in the workforce during and after 
                  the conflicts. The wars also sparked decolonization movements, as many colonized nations sought independence after witnessing
                   the fragility of European empires. Culturally, the wars influenced art, literature, and philosophy, with many works reflecting
                    on the horrors of conflict and the human condition, 
                  while also pushing boundaries in modernism and innovation in fields like media, music, and film.</p>

                <h3>Technological Advances</h3>
                <p>Technological advances driven by war have largely negative impacts, overshadowing any positive contributions. On the negative 
                  side, wars have accelerated the development of deadly weapons, such as nuclear arms, chemical agents, and drones, leading to
                   increased destruction and civilian casualties. These innovations often prioritize military applications, diverting resources 
                   from humanitarian needs and causing long-term harm, including environmental damage and ongoing conflict. The psychological and
                    social impacts of these technologies further complicate their legacy, as they contribute to a culture of fear and mistrust. While
                     some wartime technologies have beneficial civilian applications—like medical advancements, radar, and jet engines—the overall legacy 
                     of war-driven innovation is marred by its association with devastation and instability. Ultimately,
                   the challenge remains to harness technological progress for peace rather than for destruction.</p>
